The garden was blessed by the Gods of me and you
We headed West to find ourselves some truth, ooh

What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?

We counted all our reasons
Excuses that we made
We found ourselves some treasure
And threw it all away, ooh

What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?

When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me

What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?

Caught in the tide of blossom
Caught in the carnival
Your confidence forgotten
I see the gypsies rule, ooh

What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?

When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me

What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?

When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me

When I dance alone
I know I'll go
Blame it on me
When I lose control
I know I'll go
Blame it on me

What you waiting for?
No,what you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
No, what you waiting for?
