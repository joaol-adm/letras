Come now, swing wide those gates
'Cause I have paid my penance
kindly well in time for judgment day
Somehow I knew my fate
Turns out the gods we thought
were dying were just sharpening their blades

Have you been waiting long
For me?

I am the final dawn, I am the flood
And what was missing from those scriptures
will be written in my blood
Dig down into the mud
What good is all this talk of wings
when there is nothing left above?

Have you been waiting long
For me?
Have you been waiting long?

No matter how we feel
We've got a taste for one another
and a few good years to kill
No matter what is real
It seems that even in Arcadia you walk beside me still

Have you been waiting long
For me?
Have you been waiting long
For me?
.
